# Contributing Guidelines
Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. No matter if it's a bug report, a new feature, a corrected string, or additional documentation, we greatly value your time and effort.

We have prepared this document to ensure we have all the necessary information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution. Please make sure you read this before submitting any issues or working pull requests.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue before making a change. 


## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests
We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open or recently closed issues first to ensure nobody else has already reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of WordPress and our plugin in your install
* Names of other plugins and themes you've used while discovering a bug
* Anything unusual about your environment


## Contributing via Pull Requests
Contributions via pull requests are very much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.
2. You check existing open and recently merged pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Ensure local tests pass.
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages and an adequate amount of commits. Both commit spamming, and big monolithic commits make it hard for us to review your code.
5. Send us your pull request.
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.

If this is your first time contributing via GitHub, make sure to reach out to us. We are here to help you along the way. Also, check GitHub's document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).


## Finding something to work on
