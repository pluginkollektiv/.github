### Hi, We are the Pluginkollektiv ðŸ‘‹
The Pluginkollektiv is a group of WordPress folks from Europe determined to manage some beloved plugins in the WordPress.org plugin directory. Have you ever heard of Antispam Bee, Statify, or Cachify? Well, that's us. ðŸ™‚

## Get involved
All Pluginkolletiv plugins are developed and supported by a passionate group of users and developers from all over Europe. But: no matter where you live or work, you can join the Pluginkollektiv and help in our quest of delivering excellent and easy-to-use software, meeting our user's needs. First, let's get rid of the common myth that only geeks can contribute to plugins. That's simply not true!

Whatever your skillset, there are lots of ways you can contribute. You'll get at least as much out of it as you put in, and the more you are involved, the more opportunities come along. Karma rocks!
