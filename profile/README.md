### Hi, We are the Pluginkollektiv ðŸ‘‹
The Pluginkollektiv is a group of WordPress folks from Europe, determined to take care of some beloved plugins in the WordPress.org plugin directory. Ever heard of Antispam Bee, Statify or Cachify? Well thatâ€™s us. ðŸ™‚

## Get involved
All Pluginkolletiv plugins are developed and supported by a passionate group of users and developers from all over Europe. But: no matter where you live or work you can join the Pluginkollektiv and help in our quest of delivering amazing and easy to use software, meeting our users needs. First, letâ€™s get rid of the common myth, that only geeks can contribute to plugins. Thatâ€™s just not true!

Whatever your skill set, there are lots of ways you can contribute. Youâ€™ll get at least as much out of it as you put in, and the more you are involved, the more opportunities come along. Karma rocks!
